## Summary
Asliipa Jiliicofmog (Asliipa) is a sandbox topdown 2D game set in an original fantasy setting, where you are free to do anything you want. The game is intentionally designed to be somewhat unintuitive and unforgiving (what would you expect from an unfamiliar magical world?), even to the point of having its own language (to which you can switch your UI if you're so inclined)

## Running
Asliipa uses minimal amount of dependencies (Newtonsoft Json & [Monogame framework](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame)), so downloading the solution file and building it would be sufficient. Alternatively, if there are releases available, you can [download](https://github.com/Beriff/AsliipaJiliicofmog/releases) .exe file directly.

## Roadmap
### Far-fetched goals:
1. Multiplayer
2. Modding
## Active goals:
1. Finishing the bare necessary gameplay loop
2. Implementing new mechanics (forging, alchemy, crafting)
